# **CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW**

## **Description**

`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` is used to create a new view or, when the view already exists, replace the existing view. This means updating the definition of the view when it already exists without the need to delete the existing view.

## **Syntax**

```
> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Explanations

- `view_name`: The name of the view to be created or replaced. You need to specify a unique name for the view.

- `AS`: Indicates that the following query statement is the query definition of the view.

- `SELECT column1, column2, ...`: After the AS keyword, you need to specify the query definition of the view. This SELECT statement can select specific columns from a table using computed fields, expressions, and more. The view will use the result of this query as its data.

- `FROM table_name`: The `FROM` clause is used to specify the table's name to be queried. Select one or more tables and perform related operations in the view.

- `WHERE condition`: An optional `WHERE` clause used to filter the query results.

## **Examples**

```sql
-- Create a table t1 with two columns, a and b
create table t1 (a int, b int);

-- Insert three rows of data into table t1
insert into t1 values (1, 11), (2, 22), (3, 33);

-- Create a view v1 that includes all data from table t1
create view v1 as select * from t1;

-- Query all data from view v1
mysql> select * from v1;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    1 |   11 |
|    2 |   22 |
|    3 |   33 |
+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

-- Query data from view v1 where column a is greater than 1
mysql> select * from v1 where a > 1;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    2 |   22 |
|    3 |   33 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

-- Replace view v1 with a new view that only includes data from table t1 where column a is greater than 1
create or replace view v1 as select * from t1 where a > 1;

-- Query view v1 again, now containing data that meets the new condition
mysql> select * from v1;
+------+------+
| a    | b    |
+------+------+
|    2 |   22 |
|    3 |   33 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
