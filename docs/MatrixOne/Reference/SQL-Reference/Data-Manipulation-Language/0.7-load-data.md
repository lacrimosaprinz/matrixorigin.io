# **LOAD DATA**

## **Description**

The LOAD DATA statement reads rows from a text file into a table at a very high speed. The file can be read from the server host or a [S3 compatible object storage](../../../Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-s3.md). `LOAD DATA` is the complement of [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](../../../Develop/export-data/select-into-outfile.md). To write data from a table to a file, use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`. To read the file back into a table, use LOAD DATA. The syntax of the `FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses is the same for both statements.

## **Syntax**

```
> LOAD DATA [LOCAL]
    INFILE 'file_name'
    INTO TABLE tbl_name
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
    ]
    [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}]
    [PARALLEL {'TRUE' | 'FALSE'}]
```

### Input File Location

- `LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name'`: Indicates that the data file to be loaded is on the same machine as the MatrixOne host server. `file_name` can be the relative path name of the storage location of the file, or it can be the absolute path name.

- `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'file_name'`: indicates that the data file to be loaded is not on the same machine as the MatrixOne host server; that is, the data file is on the client server. `file_name` can be the relative path name of the storage location of the file, or it can be the absolute path name.

### IGNORE LINES

The IGNORE number LINES clause can be used to ignore lines at the start of the file. For example, you can use `IGNORE 1 LINES` to skip an initial header line containing column names:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE table1 IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

### Field and Line Handling

For both the LOAD DATA and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` statements, the syntax of the FIELDS and LINES clauses is the same. Both clauses are optional, but FIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified.

If you specify a `FIELDS` clause, each of its subclauses (`TERMINATED BY`, `[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY`, and `ESCAPED BY`) is also optional, except that you must specify at least one of them. Arguments to these clauses are permitted to contain only ASCII characters.

If you specify no `FIELDS` or `LINES` clause, the defaults are the same as if you had written this:

```
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
```

**FIELDS TERMINATED BY**

`FIELDS TERMINATED BY` specifies the delimiter for a field. The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` values can be more than one character.

For example, to read the comma-delimited file, the correct statement is:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```

If instead you tried to read the file with the statement shown following, it would not work because it instructs `LOAD DATA` to look for tabs between fields:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
```

The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as a single field. You may encounter an error of `"ERROR 20101 (HY000): internal error: the table column is larger than input data column"`.

**FIELDS ENCLOSED BY**

`FIELDS TERMINATED BY` option specifies the character enclose the input values. `ENCLOSED BY` value must be a single character. If the input values are not necessarily enclosed within quotation marks, use `OPTIONALLY` before the `ENCLOSED BY` option.

For example, if some input values are enclosed within quotation marks, some are not:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"';
```

**FIELDS ESCAPED BY**

`ESCAPE BY` option controls how to read or write special characters. `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` values must be a single character.

For input, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is not empty, occurrences of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally as part of a field value. Some two-character sequences that are exceptions, where the first character is the escape character. These sequences are shown in the following table (using \ for the escape character). The rules for `NULL` handling are described later in this section. If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is empty, escape-sequence interpretation does not occur.

|  Character   | Escape Sequence  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| \0 | 	An ASCII NUL (X'00') character |
| \b | 	A backspace character |
| \n | 	A newline (linefeed) character |
| \r | 	A carriage return character |
| \t | 	A tab character. |
| \Z | 	ASCII 26 (Control+Z) |
| \N | 	NULL |

For example, if some input values are special character `\`, you can use `escape by` as:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\';
```

**LINES TERMINATED BY**

`LINES TERMINATED BY` specifies the delimiter for the a line. The `LINES TERMINATED BY` values can be more than one character.

For example, if the lines in a csv file are terminated by carriage return/newline pairs, you can load it with `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'`:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
```

**LINE STARTING BY**

If all the input lines have a common prefix that you want to ignore, you can use `LINES STARTING BY` 'prefix_string' to skip the prefix and anything before it. If a line does not include the prefix, the entire line is skipped. Suppose that you issue the following statement:

```
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE table1
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  LINES STARTING BY 'xxx';
```

If the data file looks like this:

```
xxx"abc",1
something xxx"def",2
"ghi",3
```

The resulting rows are ("abc",1) and ("def",2). The third row in the file is skipped because it does not contain the prefix.

### PARALLEL

For a sizeable well-formed file, such as a *JSOLLines* file or a *CSV* file with no line breaks in a line of data, you can use `PARALLEL` to load the file in parallel to speed up the loading.

For example, for a large file of 2 G, use two threads to load; the second thread first splits and locates the 1G position, then reads and loads backward. In this way, two threads can read large files at the same time, and each thread can read 1G of data.

**Enable/Disable Parallel Loading Command Line Example**:

```
// Enable Parallel Loading
load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 LINES PARALLEL 'TRUE';

// Disable Parallel Loading
load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 LINES PARALLEL 'FALSE';

// Parallel loading is disabled by default
load data infile 'file_name' into table tbl_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

__Note:__ If the `PARALLEL` field is not added in the `LOAD` statement, for *CSV* files, parallel loading is disabled by default; for *JSOLLines* files, parallel loading is enabled by default. If there is a line terminator in the *CSV* file, such as '\n', otherwise it may cause data errors when the file is loaded. If the file is too large, manually splitting the file from the '\n' as the starting and ending point is recommended, then enabling parallel loading.

## Supported file formats

In MatrixOne's current release, `LOAD DATA` supports CSV(comma-separated values) format and JSONLines format file.
See full tutorials for loading [csv](../../../Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-csv.md) and [jsonline](../../../Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-jsonline.md).

## **Examples**

The SSB Test is an example of LOAD DATA syntax. [Complete a SSB Test with MatrixOne](../../../Test/performance-testing/SSB-test-with-matrixone.md)

```
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/ssb-dbgen-path/lineorder_flat.tbl ' INTO TABLE lineorder_flat;
```

The above statement means: load the *lineorder_flat.tbl* data set under the directory path */ssb-dbgen-path/* into the MatrixOne data table *lineorder_flat*.

You can also refer to the following syntax examples to quickly understand `LOAD DATA`:

### Example 1: LOAD CSV

#### Simple example

The data in the file locally named *char_varchar.csv* is as follows:

```
a|b|c|d
"a"|"b"|"c"|"d"
'a'|'b'|'c'|'d'
"'a'"|"'b'"|"'c'"|"'d'"
"aa|aa"|"bb|bb"|"cc|cc"|"dd|dd"
"aa|"|"bb|"|"cc|"|"dd|"
"aa|||aa"|"bb|||bb"|"cc|||cc"|"dd|||dd"
"aa'|'||aa"|"bb'|'||bb"|"cc'|'||cc"|"dd'|'||dd"
aa"aa|bb"bb|cc"cc|dd"dd
"aa"aa"|"bb"bb"|"cc"cc"|"dd"dd"
"aa""aa"|"bb""bb"|"cc""cc"|"dd""dd"
"aa"""aa"|"bb"""bb"|"cc"""cc"|"dd"""dd"
"aa""""aa"|"bb""""bb"|"cc""""cc"|"dd""""dd"
"aa""|aa"|"bb""|bb"|"cc""|cc"|"dd""|dd"
"aa""""|aa"|"bb""""|bb"|"cc""""|cc"|"dd""""|dd"
|||
||||
""|""|""|
""""|""""|""""|""""
""""""|""""""|""""""|""""""
```

Create a table named t1 in MatrixOne:

```sql
mysql> drop table if exists t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> create table t1(
    -> col1 char(225),
    -> col2 varchar(225),
    -> col3 text,
    -> col4 varchar(225)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

Load the data file into table t1:

```sql
load data infile '<your-local-file-path>/char_varchar.csv' into table t1 fields terminated by'|';
```

The query result is as follows:

```
mysql> select * from t1;
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| col1      | col2      | col3      | col4      |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| a         | b         | c         | d         |
| a         | b         | c         | d         |
| 'a'       | 'b'       | 'c'       | 'd'       |
| 'a'       | 'b'       | 'c'       | 'd'       |
| aa|aa     | bb|bb     | cc|cc     | dd|dd     |
| aa|       | bb|       | cc|       | dd|       |
| aa|||aa   | bb|||bb   | cc|||cc   | dd|||dd   |
| aa'|'||aa | bb'|'||bb | cc'|'||cc | dd'|'||dd |
| aa"aa     | bb"bb     | cc"cc     | dd"dd     |
| aa"aa     | bb"bb     | cc"cc     | dd"dd     |
| aa"aa     | bb"bb     | cc"cc     | dd"dd     |
| aa""aa    | bb""bb    | cc""cc    | dd""dd    |
| aa""aa    | bb""bb    | cc""cc    | dd""dd    |
| aa"|aa    | bb"|bb    | cc"|cc    | dd"|dd    |
| aa""|aa   | bb""|bb   | cc""|cc   | dd""|dd   |
|           |           |           |           |
|           |           |           |           |
|           |           |           |           |
| "         | "         | "         | "         |
| ""        | ""        | ""        | ""        |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
20 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Add conditional Example

Following the example above, you can modify the `LOAD DATA` statement and add `LINES STARTING BY 'aa' ignore 10 lines;` at the end of the statement to experience the difference:

```sql
delete from t1;
load data infile '<your-local-file-path>/char_varchar.csv' into table t1 fields terminated by'|' LINES STARTING BY 'aa' ignore 10 lines;
```

The query result is as follows:

```sql
mysql> select * from t1;
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| col1    | col2    | col3    | col4    |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| aa"aa   | bb"bb   | cc"cc   | dd"dd   |
| aa""aa  | bb""bb  | cc""cc  | dd""dd  |
| aa""aa  | bb""bb  | cc""cc  | dd""dd  |
| aa"|aa  | bb"|bb  | cc"|cc  | dd"|dd  |
| aa""|aa | bb""|bb | cc""|cc | dd""|dd |
|         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |
| "       | "       | "       | "       |
| ""      | ""      | ""      | ""      |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

As you can see, the query result ignores the first line and
and ignores the common prefix aa.

### Example 2: LOAD JSONLines

#### Simple example

The data in the file locally named *jsonline_array.jl* is as follows:

```
[true,1,"var","2020-09-07","2020-09-07 00:00:00","2020-09-07 00:00:00","18",121.11,["1",2,null,false,true,{"q":1}],"1qaz",null,null]
["true","1","var","2020-09-07","2020-09-07 00:00:00","2020-09-07 00:00:00","18","121.11",{"c":1,"b":["a","b",{"q":4}]},"1aza",null,null]
```

Create a table named t1 in MatrixOne:

```sql
mysql> drop table if exists t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> create table t1(col1 bool,col2 int,col3 varchar(100), col4 date,col5 datetime,col6 timestamp,col7 decimal,col8 float,col9 json,col10 text,col11 json,col12 bool);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

Load the data file into table t1:

```
load data infile {'filepath'='<your-local-file-path>/jsonline_array.jl','format'='jsonline','jsondata'='array'} into table t1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```sql
mysql> select * from t1;
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
| col1 | col2 | col3 | col4       | col5                | col6                | col7 | col8   | col9                                  | col10 | col11 | col12 |
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
| true |    1 | var  | 2020-09-07 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 |   18 | 121.11 | ["1", 2, null, false, true, {"q": 1}] | 1qaz  | NULL  | NULL  |
| true |    1 | var  | 2020-09-07 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 |   18 | 121.11 | {"b": ["a", "b", {"q": 4}], "c": 1}   | 1aza  | NULL  | NULL  |
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

#### Add conditional Example

Following the example above, you can modify the `LOAD DATA` statement and add `ignore 1 lines` at the end of the statement to experience the difference:

```
delete from t1;
load data infile {'filepath'='<your-local-file-path>/jsonline_array.jl','format'='jsonline','jsondata'='array'} into table t1 ignore 1 lines;
```

The query result is as follows:

```sql
mysql> select * from t1;
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+-------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
| col1 | col2 | col3 | col4       | col5                | col6                | col7 | col8   | col9                                | col10 | col11 | col12 |
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+-------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
| true |    1 | var  | 2020-09-07 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 | 2020-09-07 00:00:00 |   18 | 121.11 | {"b": ["a", "b", {"q": 4}], "c": 1} | 1aza  | NULL  | NULL  |
+------+------+------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+------+--------+-------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As you can see, the query result ignores the first line.

For more information on loding *JSONLines*, see [Import the JSONLines data](../../../Develop/import-data/bulk-load/load-jsonline.md).

## **Constraints**

1. The `REPLACE` and `IGNORE` modifiers control handling of new (input) rows that duplicate existing table rows on unique key values (`PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE index` values) are not supported in MatrixOne yet.
2. Input pre-pressing with `SET` is supported very limitedly. Only `SET columns_name=nullif(expr1,expr2)` is supported.
3. When enabling the parallel loading, it must be ensured that each row of data in the file does not contain the specified line terminator, such as '\n'; otherwise, it will cause data errors during file loading.
4. The parallel loading of files requires that the files be in uncompressed format, and parallel loading of files in compressed form is not currently supported.
