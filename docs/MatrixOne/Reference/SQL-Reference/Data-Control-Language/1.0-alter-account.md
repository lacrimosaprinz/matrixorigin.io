# **ALTER ACCOUNT**

## **Description**

Modify account information.

!!! note
    1. The cluster administrator (i.e., the root user) can modify the password of the account it creates.
    2. Accounts themselves can modify their own passwords.
    2. Only the cluster administrator (i.e., the root user) can perform **SUSPEND** ​​and **RECOVER (OPEN)** account operations.

## **Syntax**

```
> ALTER ACCOUNT [IF EXISTS]
account auth_option [COMMENT 'comment_string']

auth_option: {
ADMIN_NAME [=] 'admin_name'
IDENTIFIED BY 'auth_string'
}

status_option: {
OPEN
| SUSPEND
| RESTRICTED
}
```

### Explanations

### auth_option

Modifies the account's default account name and authorization mode, `auth_string` specifies the password explicitly.

### status_option

Set the state of the account. They are stored as VARCHAR in the mo_account table under the system database mo_catalog.

- SUSPEND: Suspend the account's service; the account can no longer access MatrixOne after the suspension.
    * When the `SUSPEND` state is enabled for the account, access behavior will be suspended even if the account is accessing it.
    * To unsuspend the user's service, switch the status to `OPEN` to unsuspend the service; that is, run `ALTER ACCOUNT account_name OPEN` to unsuspend the service.

- OPEN: Resume a suspended account, after which the account will usually access MatrixOne.
- RESTRICTED: Allows the user to access and perform limited actions. After the `RESTRICTED` state is enabled for this tenant, this tenant can only perform `SHOW`/`DELETE`/`SELECT`/`USE` operations on the database, and other operations cannot be used.
    * When the `RESTRICTED` state is enabled for the tenant, access behavior will be restricted even if the account is accessing it.
    * To lift the restrictions on the user, switch the status to `OPEN` to remove the restrictions.

### comment

Account notes are stored as VARCHAR in the table *mo_account* in the system database *mo_catalog*.

`COMMENT` can be arbitrary quoted text, and the new `COMMENT` replaces any existing user comments. As follows:

```sql
mysql> desc mo_catalog.mo_account;
+----------------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+
| Field          | Type         | Null | Key  | Default | Extra | Comment |
+----------------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+
| account_id     | INT          | YES  |      | NULL    |       |         |
| account_name   | VARCHAR(300) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |         |
| status         | VARCHAR(300) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |         |
| created_time   | TIMESTAMP    | YES  |      | NULL    |       |         |
| comments       | VARCHAR(256) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |         |
| suspended_time | TIMESTAMP    | YES  |      | null    |       |         |
+----------------+--------------+------+------+---------+-------+---------+
6 rows in set (0.06 sec)
```

## **Examples**

- Example 1: Modify the information on the account

```sql
-- Create a account named "root1" with password "111"
mysql> create account acc1 admin_name "root1" identified by "111";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.42 sec)
-- Change the initial password "111" to "Abcd_1234@1234"
mysql> alter account acc1 admin_name "root1" identified by "Abcd_1234@1234";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
-- Modify the comment for account "root1"
mysql> alter account acc1 comment "new account";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
-- Check to verify that the "new account" comment has been added to the account "root1"
mysql> show accounts;
+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+
| account_name | admin_name | created             | status | suspended_time | db_count | table_count | row_count | size  | comment        |
+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+
| acc1         | root1      | 2023-02-15 06:26:51 | open   | NULL           |        5 |          34 |       787 | 0.036 | new account    |
| sys          | root       | 2023-02-14 06:58:15 | open   | NULL           |        8 |          57 |      3767 | 0.599 | system account |
+--------------+------------+---------------------+--------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.19 sec)
```

- Example 2: Modify the status of the account

```sql
-- Create a account named "root1" with password "111"
mysql> create account accx admin_name "root1" identified by "111";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.27 sec)
-- Modify the account status to "suspend", that is, suspend user access to MatrixOne.
mysql> alter account accx suspend;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
-- Check if the modification status is successful.
mysql> show accounts;
+--------------+------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+
| account_name | admin_name | created             | status  | suspended_time      | db_count | table_count | row_count | size  | comment        |
+--------------+------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------+----------------+
| accx         | root1      | 2023-02-15 06:26:51 | suspend | 2023-02-15 06:27:15 |        5 |          34 |       787 | 0.036 | new accout     |
| sys          | root       | 2023-02-14 06:58:15 | open    | NULL                |        8 |          57 |      3767 | 0.599 | system account |
