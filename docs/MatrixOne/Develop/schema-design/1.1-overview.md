# Database Schema Design Overview

This document provides the basics of MatrixOne database schema design. This document introduces terminology related to MatrixOne databases and subsequent data read and write examples.

## Key concept in MatrixOne

Database Schema: The database schema mentioned in this article is the same as the logical object database. It is the same as MySQL.

## Database

A database in MatrixOne is a collection of objects such as tables.

To view the default database contained by MatrixOne, ues `SHOW DATABASES;` statment.

To create a new database, ues `CREATE DATABASE database_name;` statement.

## Table

A table is a collection of related data in a database.

Each table consists of rows and columns. Each value in a row belongs to a specific column. Each column allows only a single data type. To further qualify columns, you can add some constraints.

## Index

An index is a data structure used to find data in database tables quickly. It can be seen as a 'table of contents' that contains pointers to the data of each row in the table, making it possible for queries to locate data that meets specific conditions more quickly.

The indexes commonly used in databases include primary key indexes, secondary indexes, etc. Among them, unique indexes are used to ensure the uniqueness of specific columns or combinations of columns, ordinary indexes are used to improve query performance, and full-text indexes are used for full-text search in text data.

There are two common types of indexes, namely:

- **Primary Key**: Primary key index, the index that identifies the primary key column. The primary key index uniquely identifies each row of data in the table.
- **Secondary index**: The secondary index is identified on the non-primary key. The secondary index, a non-clustered index, is used to improve query performance and speed up data retrieval.

__Note:__ Currently, MatrixOne only supports **Primary Key**.

## Vector

MatrixOne now supports storing and querying vectors. Vector is a numerical array generally produced by AI models, including Large Language Models. These vectors can be seamlessly stored and queried, allowing for tasks like finding nearest neighbors, all while accommodating relational data.

__Note:__ Currently, MatrixOne only supports inserting and querying vector data.

For more information, see [vector](vector.md)

## Other supported logical objects

MatrixOne supports the following logical objects at the same level as the table:

- View: a view acts as a virtual table whose schema is defined by the SELECT statement that creates the view.

- Temporary table: a table whose data is not persistent.

## Access Control

MatrixOne supports both user-based and role-based access control. To allow users to view, modify, or delete data, for more information, see [Access control in MatrixOne](../../Security/role-priviledge-management/about-privilege-management.md).

## Object limitations

### Limitations on identifier length

|Identifier type|Maximum length (number of characters allowed)|
|---|---|
|Database|64|
|Table|64|
|Column|64|
|Sequence|64|

### Limitations on a single table

|Type|Upper limit (default value)|
|---|---|
|Columns|Defaults to 1017 and can be adjusted up to 4096|
|Partitions|8192|
|Size of a single line|6 MB by default|
|Size of a single column|6 MB|

### Limitations on data types

For more information on data types, see [Data Types](../../Reference/Data-Types/data-types.md).

### Number of rows

MatrixOne supports an unlimited number of rows by adding nodes to the cluster.
